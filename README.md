This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is based on Wes Bos' [Redux Crash Course with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93p3LxR9xfM) in which we build add Redux, React-Redux, and Redux-Thunk to a simple React application. The app renders posts from the jsonplaceholder API and allows a user to add a new post.

## Running the project

## Getting the app up & running

git clone https://github.com/gabygandrade/redux-crash-course.git
